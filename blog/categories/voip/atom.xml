About 2 months a ago, one day server of our customer decided to response empty string on <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+Manager+API+Action+Command">Command Action</a>. we feed bunch of data for reporting with AMI and especially with Command Action.<div><br /><div>It was so mystery for us ! what happen suddenly ? anyway we were lucky, we had a backup and moved server to backup ones.</div><div><br /></div><div>After works on that server we discovered this problem solved when we run asterisk as a root !</div><div>Anyway we did not work on that server until today. I get asterisk source code and debug lines and found a problem :</div><div>For unknown reason ownership of /tmp was different from always and a function wants to create temporary file but could not access to /tmp (file main/manager.c about line 1736).</div><div><br /></div><div>If Asterisk Developers checks  return value of mkstemp and debug if value is -1, life would be more pleasure </div></div></div>

About 3 month ago we had a problem on ChanSpy in Asterisk. sounds were out of sync.<div>We do everything ! changing asterisk version, compiling different version of asterisk ! </div><div>Users of that customer use EyeBeam as SIP Client, in asterisk bug tracker someone wrote there is a problem with onboard sound cards. so that we take a PAP2 and test ChanSpy with ordinary telephone and Bingoo ! everything was sync !</div><div><br /></div><div>We did update  EyeBeams and problem solved.</div><div><br /></div><div>These days I have problem like before, this time problem is files which recorded by MixMonitor are out of sync. tomorrow I am going to take PAP2 to that location and test files. I hope problem solves by changing EyeBeam or even add PCI sound card.</div><div><br /></div><div>I will update this post when get answer.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Update<span style="font-weight: bold;"> : </span></span><span><br />problem solved by updating asterisk to 1.4.27.3</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> !<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span><br /></span></div></div>
