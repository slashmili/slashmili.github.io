About 3 month ago we had a problem on ChanSpy in Asterisk. sounds were out of sync.<div>We do everything ! changing asterisk version, compiling different version of asterisk ! </div><div>Users of that customer use EyeBeam as SIP Client, in asterisk bug tracker someone wrote there is a problem with onboard sound cards. so that we take a PAP2 and test ChanSpy with ordinary telephone and Bingoo ! everything was sync !</div><div><br /></div><div>We did update  EyeBeams and problem solved.</div><div><br /></div><div>These days I have problem like before, this time problem is files which recorded by MixMonitor are out of sync. tomorrow I am going to take PAP2 to that location and test files. I hope problem solves by changing EyeBeam or even add PCI sound card.</div><div><br /></div><div>I will update this post when get answer.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Update<span style="font-weight: bold;"> : </span></span><span><br />problem solved by updating asterisk to 1.4.27.3</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> !<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span><br /></span></div></div>
