<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>As currently my life is kind of stuck into Zenoss, I made another tools for Zenoss.</p>  <p>This time, it's a Google Chrome's plugin, I can say it's more useful than <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.slashmili.Zendroid">Zenroid</a>, because you can watch out server's alarm while you are browsing the web.</p>  <p>You can get source from <a href="https://github.com/slashmili/zenchor">zenchor</a>&nbsp;repo and install it from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hibkfafceeekmknadpglakdnmaiigonp?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon">Chrome Web Store</a>.</p></div></div>
