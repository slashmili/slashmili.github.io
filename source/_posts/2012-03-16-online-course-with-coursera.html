<div class='posterous_autopost'><p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> is online education center, it's aim is to bring education for free to any person who is seeking for that.</p>  <p>I enrolled for three courses but I've only managed to attend one of them since 1 week ago that I registered.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Software as a Service</strong> course is really great course for person who wants to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" title="Ruby">Ruby</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and beside that you have fun class. Even though is so soon to judge about Rails but I've already missed <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.</p>  <p>I like their teaching method, you follow&nbsp;lectures and do homework related to the lectures, and they give you a score for you works(apparently your submitted files is runed with unittest and each test has score). I've already learnt a lot about Ruby just with following course and doing homework.</p>  <p>After all don't miss.</p></div></div>
