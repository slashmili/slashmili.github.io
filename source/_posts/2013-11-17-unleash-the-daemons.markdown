I gave a talk at [KL Ruby Brigade](https://github.com/klxrb) monthly meeting about Daemons in Unix environment.

If you want to know what the Daemon is, here is a quick explanation:
> In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon (/ˈdeɪmən/ or /ˈdiːmən/) is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_%28computing%29)
