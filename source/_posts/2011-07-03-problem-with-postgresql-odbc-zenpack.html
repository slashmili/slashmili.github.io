<div class="posterous_autopost"><p>In my new job(if after 8 months you can count it as new!) I am responsible to maintain <a href="http://zenoss.org/" target="_blank">Zenoss</a> and some week I am on call for Zenoss's Alarm.</p>  <p>One of the strangest problem that we had was about <a href="http://community.zenoss.org/docs/DOC-3497">PostgreSQL ODBC Database Monitor</a> package. suddenly zenperfsql stopped without any log.</p>  <p>I tried to run zenperfsql in debug mode and I hoped that I would fix the problem. but after the daemon died again the error that I saw was : </p>  <p><code>python: pthread_mutex_lock.c:62: __pthread_mutex_lock: Assertion `mutex-&gt;__data.__owner == 0' failed.</code></p>  <p>I never thought that I would face to python's thread stuff ! as far as I knew Zenoss use <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> framework and this error just happened for sql daemon so I reviewed the way that we had installed the packahe</p>  <p>For using this package you need to follow these steps </p>  <p><code>    /usr/local/zenoss/python/bin/easy_install pyodbc    apt-get install odbc-postgresq    apt-get install unixodbc-dev    </code></p>  <p>And edit /etc/odbcinst.ini, here is the tricky part, if you follow unixodbc document, it recommends you to config like :</p>  <p><code>    [PostgreSQL] Description     = PostgreSQL ODBC driver (Unicode version) Driver          = /usr/lib/odbc/psqlodbca.so Setup           = /usr/lib/odbc/libodbcpsqlS.so    </code></p>  <p>But you need to add an other line which is specifying number of Threads </p>  <p>  </p><p><code>    [PostgreSQL] Description     = PostgreSQL ODBC driver (Unicode version) Driver          = /usr/lib/odbc/psqlodbca.so Setup           = /usr/lib/odbc/libodbcpsqlS.so Threading = 2    </code></p>  <p> </p>  <p>After adding Threading line I never face that problem, I dunno why Twisted which is built as asynchronous framework can not handle this and we need to limit ODBC's Thread.</p>  <p> </p>  <p><strong>UPDATE :</strong></p>  <p>I found another blog that he faced same problem and he explains the reason (<a href="http://hynek.me/blog/2011/04/twisted-sybase/">see more</a>)</p>  <p>  </p></div></div>
