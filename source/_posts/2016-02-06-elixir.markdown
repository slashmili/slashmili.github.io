It was almost a year ago that I got introduced to [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).
I remember my first impression was yet another language on top of another one.
In addition running a software on [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org/), it's totally different beast,
so I was a bit skeptical it. However I gave it a chance and after a year,
I'm totally happy with the time I spend and
I believe that every one should take advantage of the language and the platform that is running on.


## Why Elixir?

### Elegant & Expressive

```elixir
urls = ["http://google.com", "http://trello.com"]
random_url = urls |> Enum.shuffle |> List.first
```

Do I need to explain the code? Don't think so!
And if you have a bit of unix background this code should make sense to you.

> <small>Note: yes, there is an easy way to get random item(`Enum.random`), the above code is just for making the point.</small>

If you are not familiar with functional programming, it might take sometime to get to use
to that, after you un-learn your OOP skills, you'll find that every thing make sense in Elixir land.
