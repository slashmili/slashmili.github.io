It was almost a year ago that I got introduced to [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).
I remember my first impression was yet another language on top of another one.
In addition running a software on [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org/), it's totally different beast,
so I was a bit skeptical it. However I gave it a chance and after a year,
I'm totally happy with the time I spend and
I believe that every one should take advantage of the language and the platform that is running on.
